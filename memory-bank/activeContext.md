# Active Context - Vimeo Monitor Project

## Current Focus
- **Project**: vimeo-monitor - Python-based video kiosk for Raspberry Pi 5
- **Phase**: Creative Phase Complete - Environment Setup Implementation Complete
- **Mode**: PLAN (Progress Update)
- **Status**: Architecture design decisions completed

## Key Context
- **Platform**: Linux (Raspberry Pi 5)
- **Environment**: X11 desktop with auto-login
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Purpose**: Self-launching video kiosk with Vimeo API integration
- **Architecture**: Hybrid Approach with Process Manager selected

## Current Task
Updating progress tracking and preparing for implementation phase.

## Recent Activity
- ✅ Memory Bank system setup completed
- ✅ Project complexity assessed as Level 3
- ✅ Comprehensive planning completed
- ✅ Creative phase completed with architecture decisions
  - ✅ Environment setup design completed (Dependabot, GitHub Actions, CI/CD)
- ✅ Architecture document created: creative-architecture.md

## Architecture Decisions Made
- **Process Management**: Hybrid Approach with Process Manager
- **State Machine**: Three states (Stream, No Stream, API Failure) with hysteresis
- **Error Handling**: Circuit breaker pattern with exponential backoff
- **Player Management**: Lightweight Process Manager with subprocess control
- **Health Monitoring**: Integrated health checks and metrics

## Next Steps
- Update progress tracking (completed)
- Transition to IMPLEMENT mode
- Begin code implementation based on architecture decisions
- Start with core modules: config.py, metrics.py, client.py

## Creative Phase Status
- **Document**: creative-architecture.md created and completed
- **Decision**: Hybrid Approach with Process Manager
- **Components**: All architecture components designed and documented
- **Ready**: Yes, for implementation phase
  - ✅ Environment setup implementation completed (all workflows and configurations created)
