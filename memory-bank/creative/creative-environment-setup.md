# 🎨🎨🎨 ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: ENVIRONMENT SETUP DESIGN 🎨🎨🎨

## Component: Development Environment Setup

### Component Description
Design and implement a comprehensive development environment setup including Dependabot configuration for UV dependency management, GitHub Actions for MkDocs documentation publishing, and a basic CI/CD pipeline suitable for early development phases.

### Requirements & Constraints
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Automate dependency updates using Dependabot with UV support
  - Automate MkDocs documentation publishing to GitHub Pages
  - Implement basic CI/CD pipeline for development workflow
  - Support both development and production deployment scenarios

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Must work with UV package manager (not pip)
  - Should be lightweight and not overly strict for early development
  - Must integrate with existing pyproject.toml configuration
  - Should support GitHub Pages deployment
  - Must be maintainable and extensible

## 🏗️ ENVIRONMENT SETUP OPTIONS ANALYSIS

    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
      time: "09:00"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "dcapparelli"
    assignees:
      - "dcapparelli"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "deps"
      include: "scope"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "automated"
    # UV-specific configuration
    target-branch: "main"
    allow:
      - dependency-type: "direct"
      - dependency-type: "indirect"
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Design
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline

  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
