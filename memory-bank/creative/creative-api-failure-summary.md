# API Failure Handling Enhancement - Design Decisions Summary

## Overview

During the creative phase, we explored various design options for improving the API failure handling in the vimeo-monitor application. This document summarizes the key design decisions made across the three main aspects of the enhancement:

1. **Failure Detection Algorithm**
2. **Error Type Handling**
3. **Failure Image Display**

## Core Design Philosophy

The overall design philosophy for this enhancement can be summarized as:

> "Improve reliability and diagnostics while maintaining simplicity and compatibility with the existing codebase."

This philosophy guided all design decisions, leading to an approach that balances sophistication with practical implementation considerations.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Failure Detection Algorithm

**Selected Approach: Counter-Based Failure Detection**

After evaluating multiple options:

- Counter-Based Failure Detection
- Time-Window Based Detection
- Hybrid Approach with Error Type Weighting

We selected the Counter-Based approach for its:

- Simplicity and predictability
- Ease of implementation and testing
- Compatibility with existing code structure
- Configurability through environment variables

The counter-based approach tracks consecutive failures and successes, entering failure mode when failures exceed a threshold and exiting when successes exceed another threshold.

### 2. Error Type Handling

**Selected Approach: Simple Error Type Logging**

After evaluating multiple options:

- Simple Error Type Logging
- Error Type-Based Recovery Strategies
- Error Type Weighting

We selected the Simple Error Type Logging approach for its:

- Balance between improved diagnostics and implementation complexity
- Maintainability and readability
- Testability
- Sufficient improvement over the current implementation

This approach distinguishes between different error types for logging purposes but applies the same recovery strategy to all errors.

### 3. Failure Image Display

**Selected Approach: Basic Failure Image**

After evaluating multiple options:

- Basic Failure Image
- Enhanced Failure Image with Status Information
- HTML-Based Status Display

We selected the Basic Failure Image approach for its:

- Consistency with existing implementation
- Simplicity and reliability
- Low resource usage
- Customizability through image files

This approach displays a static image when API failures are detected, providing clear visual feedback without introducing additional complexity.

## Consolidated Implementation Plan

Based on these design decisions, the implementation will:

1. **Add state tracking variables:**
   - API failure and success counters
   - Failure mode flag
   - Last error type
   - Retry interval

2. **Implement helper functions:**
   - `handle_api_success()`: Reset failure counter, increment success counter, exit failure mode if stable
   - `handle_api_failure()`: Reset success counter, increment failure counter, enter failure mode if threshold exceeded
   - `calculate_backoff()`: Calculate exponential backoff for retry intervals

3. **Enhance error handling:**
   - Catch specific exception types
   - Log detailed error information
   - Track error types for diagnostics

4. **Add failure image support:**
   - Support configurable failure image path
   - Fall back to holding image if failure image not found
   - Add new "api_failure" state to state machine

5. **Add configuration options:**
   - Failure and stability thresholds
   - Minimum and maximum retry intervals
   - Backoff enable/disable flag

## Configuration Parameters

The enhancement will introduce the following configuration parameters:

```
# API failure handling configuration
API_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=3 # Number of consecutive failures before entering failure mode
API_STABILITY_THRESHOLD=5 # Number of consecutive successes before exiting failure mode
API_MIN_RETRY_INTERVAL=10 # Minimum retry interval in seconds
API_MAX_RETRY_INTERVAL=300 # Maximum retry interval in seconds
API_ENABLE_BACKOFF=true # Enable exponential backoff for retry intervals
API_FAIL_IMAGE_PATH=/path/to/failure.jpg # Path to failure image
```

## State Machine

The enhanced state machine will now include three states:

```
                    Error Count ≥ Threshold
                    ┌────────────────────┐
                    │                    │
                    ▼                    │
┌──────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│  Stream  │────▶│ No Stream │────▶│ API Failure │
│   Mode   │◀────│    Mode   │◀────│    Mode     │
└──────────┘     └───────────┘     └────────────┘
                    ▲                    │
                    │                    │
                    └────────────────────┘
                    Success Count ≥ Threshold
```

## Future Enhancement Paths

While keeping the initial implementation focused and simple, we've identified several paths for future enhancement:

1. **Error Type-Specific Recovery**: Implement differentiated recovery strategies based on error type
2. **Error Weighting System**: Apply different weights to different error types
3. **Dynamic Status Display**: Enhance the failure image with dynamic status information
4. **Network Diagnostics**: Add automated network diagnostics for connection issues
5. **Admin Notifications**: Add notifications for critical errors

These paths provide a roadmap for incremental improvements after the initial implementation is complete and validated.

## Conclusion

The design decisions made during the creative phase provide a solid foundation for implementing the API failure handling enhancement. The approach balances improved reliability and diagnostics with practical implementation considerations, resulting in a solution that:

- Enhances error detection and recovery
- Improves logging and diagnostics
- Provides clear visual feedback
- Maintains compatibility with existing code
- Allows for future enhancements

This balanced approach will deliver significant improvements to the vimeo-monitor application while minimizing implementation complexity and risk.
