## Recent Updates

- Implemented basic Vimeo API polling mechanism
- Added state management for stream/image transitions
- Created process monitoring and recovery
- Implemented logging system
- Defined systemd service for auto-launch

## Current Development Focus

- Improving error handling for API failures
- Implementing more robust process monitoring
- Testing in various failure scenarios
- Documentation for deployment

## Testing Status

| Test Scenario          | Status       | Notes                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Stream Available       | ✅ Tested     | Successfully plays stream                  |
| Stream Unavailable     | ✅ Tested     | Successfully shows holding image           |
| Process Crash Recovery | ✅ Tested     | Successfully restarts process              |
| Network Interruption   | ⚠️ Partial    | Basic recovery works but could be improved |
| API Failure            | ⚠️ Partial    | Basic handling works but needs enhancement |
| Long-term Stability    | ❌ Not Tested | Need extended runtime testing              |

## Next Steps

1. Enhance API failure handling with more sophisticated detection
2. Implement network status display overlay
3. Add log rotation mechanism
4. Create deployment documentation
5. Perform extended stability testing
