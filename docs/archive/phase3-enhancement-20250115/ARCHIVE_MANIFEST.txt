# Phase 3: Enhancement Archive Manifest

**Archive Date**: January 15, 2025
**Phase**: Enhancement (Week 3) - Error Handling & Reliability
**Status**: Completed and Archived

## Contents

### Files Archived:
- `phase3-progress.md` - Detailed progress tracking for Phase 3

### Phase 3 Deliverables:
- Comprehensive error handling throughout system
- Retry mechanisms for API failures
- Process auto-recovery on failures
- System health monitoring
- Error image display for failure states
- Exponential backoff for API retries
- Health check system with status reporting

### Key Achievements:
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout system
- Implemented retry mechanisms for API failures
- Added process auto-recovery on failures
- Implemented system health monitoring
- Added error image display for failure states
- Added comprehensive error tracking and logging
- Implemented exponential backoff for API retries
- Added health check system with status reporting
- Tested error recovery mechanisms
- Tested system stability under failure conditions

### Archive Purpose:
This archive contains the reliability and error handling improvements that transformed the Vimeo Monitor from a basic system into a robust, self-recovering application. The progress tracking shows the systematic approach to implementing comprehensive error handling.
