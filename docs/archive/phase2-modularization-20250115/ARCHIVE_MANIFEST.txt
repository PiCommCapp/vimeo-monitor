# Phase 2: Modularization Archive Manifest

**Archive Date**: January 15, 2025
**Phase**: Modularization (Week 2) - Process Management
**Status**: Completed and Archived

## Contents

### Files Archived:
- `implementation-plan.md` - Complete implementation plan for system refactoring
- `architecture-design.md` - System architecture design and decisions
- `design-patterns.md` - Design patterns and implementation guidelines
- `phase2-progress.md` - Detailed progress tracking for Phase 2

### Phase 2 Deliverables:
- Process management system (process_manager.py)
- Modular architecture design
- Subprocess handling logic extraction
- Configuration validation enhancements
- Python package structure (src/vimeo_monitor/)

### Key Achievements:
- Created process_manager.py module
- Extracted subprocess handling from main script
- Moved hardcoded paths to environment variables
- Added configuration validation to config.py
- Created proper Python package structure
- Implemented graceful shutdown and signal handling
- Added process health monitoring

### Archive Purpose:
This archive contains the core architectural decisions and implementation details for transforming the monolithic Vimeo Monitor into a modular, maintainable system. The design patterns and architecture documents provide the foundation for all subsequent phases.

### Related Archives:
- Phase 1: Foundation (prerequisites: config.py, logger.py)
- Phase 3: Enhancement (builds on process management)
- Phase 4: Hardening (production-ready process management)
