# Implementation Summary: System Service Installation

**Task ID**: TASK-010
**Completion Date**: June 4, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive system service installation solution that allows the Vimeo Monitor application to launch automatically at boot without any user interaction. The implementation supports both Linux (systemd) and macOS (launchd) platforms with security hardening and complete lifecycle management.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Service Configuration Files

#### Linux (systemd) - `services/vimeo-monitor.service`

- **Service Type**: Simple
- **User Isolation**: Dedicated `vimeo-monitor` user/group
- **Security Hardening**: 15+ security restrictions including:
  - File system protection (`ProtectSystem=strict`)
  - Network restrictions (`RestrictAddressFamilies`)
  - System call filtering (`SystemCallFilter=@system-service`)
  - Memory protection (`MemoryDenyWriteExecute`)
  - Resource limits (file descriptors, processes)
- **Auto-Restart**: Configured with failure recovery
- **Logging**: Integrated with systemd journal

#### macOS (launchd) - Generated dynamically

- **Service Type**: Daemon
- **User Isolation**: Dedicated user/group
- **Auto-Start**: `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive` enabled
- **Environment**: Proper PATH and PYTHONPATH setup
- **Logging**: File-based logging to service directory

### 2. Installation Scripts

#### `scripts/install-service.sh` (306 lines)

**Features**:

- Cross-platform OS detection (Linux/macOS)
- Automated user and group creation
- Secure directory structure setup
- Python environment installation with uv
- Service registration and enablement
- Comprehensive error handling and colored logging

**Security Measures**:

- Dedicated service user with no login shell
- Proper file permissions and ownership
- Isolated home directory
- Restricted write access

#### `scripts/uninstall-service.sh` (182 lines)

**Features**:

- Safe service removal with confirmation prompts
- Optional log backup before deletion
- Complete user and group cleanup
- Service file removal and system reload
- Restoration to original system state

### 3. Makefile Integration

Added 8 new service management commands:

```bash
make install-service      # Install system service
make uninstall-service    # Remove system service
make service-status       # Check service status
make service-start        # Start service
make service-stop         # Stop service
make service-restart      # Restart service
make service-logs         # View service logs
make setup-service        # Complete setup with service
```

Enhanced `make status` to include service installation status.
