- [ ] Test production readiness

## Completed Tasks

### Architecture & Planning
- [x] Complete architecture design and documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive implementation plan
- [x] Document all design decisions and rationale
- [x] Define module responsibilities and interfaces
- [x] Create detailed testing strategy
- [x] Plan incremental deployment approach

## Future Features (Post-Phase 4)
- Advanced error recovery strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization
- Advanced logging and metrics
- Health check endpoints
- Configuration hot-reloading

## Notes
- All tasks are designed for incremental implementation
- Each phase can be tested independently
- System maintains functionality throughout refactoring
- Focus on simple, maintainable solutions
- Avoid feature creep - stick to core requirements
